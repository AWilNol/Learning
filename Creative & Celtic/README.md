## This is Website04 of AWilNol

This site was made using Sublime Text editor and [GitHub](http://github.com/).

Site Sketch: 
![Image of my website drawings, the landing page with the logo center page with navigational page and social links in a row under logo, the inner pages with a fixed left navigation panel and information to the right.](/images/dual-mockup)

Some changes were made to the sketch upon making mockup as I realized I wouldn't utilyze as many social medias as I thought. The listing of About, Gallery, Gear, etc across top of second pages reminds of what info needs to go into pages, not necessarily how many pages are needed.

## Website04 of AWilNol

My wood art synery website was made using Sublime Text editor and [GitHub](http://github.com/) and features cool CSS like:

- buttons that move on hover
- a logo that changes on hover and click
- an interactive gallery
- pull quotes

Site Sketch: 
![Image of my website drawings, the landing page with the logo center page with navigational page and social links in a row under logo, the inner pages with a fixed left navigation panel and information to the right.](./images/dual-mockup)

Some changes were made to the sketch upon making mockup as I realized I wouldn't utilyze as many social medias as I thought, while the listing of About, Gallery, Gear, etc across top of inner pages reminds of what info needs to go into pages, not necessarily how many pages are needed.

##Fonts

###Faces

Utilizing <b #00BFFF>Tinos<b>, "by Steve Matteson, designed as an innovative, refreshing serif design", for the headings in my site. Perfect for an updated arty feel.  

<b #00BFFF>Encode Sans Condensed</b> "a veritable workhorse sans serif design... ready for all kind of typographic challenges" will be used for the body of my website. The true compliment making a fine, harmonious pairing here.

##Layout

My site will use two basic page layouts with fixed and floating elements, lower and left columns for site information, while the right columns in the inner pages handle information posts.
